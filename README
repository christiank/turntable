Turntable is a pure Ruby implementation of a relational database, similar in
spirit to SQLite. Unlike Sequel or any other object-relational mapper, Turntable
is built with Ruby from the ground up, and implements Rubyisms whenever
possible. It never goes anywhere near SQL.

Turntable databases include the Enumerable mixin, so all the methods available
there are also available for you:

  turntable.
    select { |film| film[:title] =~ /\AG/ }.
    sort_by { |film| film[:year] }.
    reverse.
    detect { |film| film[:director] == "Francis Ford Coppola" }

Oh yeah, installing it is a cinch, too.

  $ gem install turntable
