In no particular order:

* Make into a gem.

* Somehow make every Row aware of its associated TableHeader without actually
  shipping every Row with the TableHeader. 

* Make Turntable marshallable. 

* Figure out the best/most efficient way to serialize increasingly larger
  tables.

* Implement all of the SortedSet methods which are not present in Enumerable in
  such a way that does not require calling Turntable::Table#rows. (#delete_if,
  first, etc.)

* Write simpler #inspect representations of all objects.
